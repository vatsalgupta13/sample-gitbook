### Has the contract code been audited?&#x20;

Yes, the contracts have been audited by Hacken, and the audit report can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k589q3n5xmivjyr/BYOF%20Hacken%20Audit.pdf?dl=0).

### On which chain is the BYOF functionality currently live?&#x20;

Currently, the BYOF feature is only live on Polygon. We plan to extend this feature to other chains as well.

### Can only whitelisted users create farms?&#x20;

Currently, yes. Since the functionality is currently in its Beta phase, we are only allowing whitelisted addresses to create farms. However, in the spirit of being truly permissionless, we will remove this constraint in the next few weeks. The farms created by non-whitelisted users would appear under a new label called ‘Community Farms’.

### How long does it take for an address to be whitelisted?&#x20;

You can expect your address to be whitelisted in 2-4 business days.

### Can I renew the farms created using BYOF?&#x20;

Yes, as a farm creator, you will also have the option to renew your farms with the same or a different reward structure. However, this is only possible with Dual and Ecosystem farms. For Popular farms, you will need to deploy a new farm altogether.
