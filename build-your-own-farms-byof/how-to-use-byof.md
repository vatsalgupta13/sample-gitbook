### How to choose the right farm?

DFYN provides different types of farming options and each farm has different benefits. Therefore, choosing the right farming strategy is a critical consideration while deploying a farm.&#x20;

* **Ecosystem Farms -** If you want to launch a farm with single token rewards which can be claimed at any time, then Ecosystem Farms is the right choice.&#x20;
* **Dual Farms -** If you want to provide dual token rewards which will accrue block-by-block (rewards can be claimed at any time), then Dual Farms is the right option for you.&#x20;
* **Popular Farms -** This is the right venue to launch farms that require users to stake popular LPs (stablecoin pairs or pairs involving tokens such as wBTC, ETH, UNI, CRV, SOL, etc.). Popular Farms often have high APRs and attract a high TVL. Rewards from Popular Farms will be vested, but the users will also have an option to redeem their rewards earlier in exchange for forfeiting a part of their rewards.&#x20;
* **Launch Farms -** If you want to promote a new project, launch farm is the best platform for you. Rewards from launch farms will be vested over a period of time, but there is no notion of early redemption of rewards.
