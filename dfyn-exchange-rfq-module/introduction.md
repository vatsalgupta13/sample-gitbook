# Introduction

## Objective

With Dfyn's RFQ module, we aim to create a gas-efficient model that bypasses all the complexities of an AMM and connects traders directly to a set of professional market makers. This module is complementary to our existing AMM module in the sense that when using Dfyn Exchange with the RFQ functionality enabled, the user's experience is unaffected. They still make a request for trade on our UI and receive a response with an optimally routed order. Behind the scenes, Dfyn will fetch the best price available - be it on our AMM or our RFQ instance.
