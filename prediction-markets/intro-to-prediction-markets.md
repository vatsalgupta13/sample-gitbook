# Intro to Prediction Markets

We are thrilled to announce the launch of prediction markets on the Dfyn Exchange. Our newly introduced prediction markets will allow users to predict if the price of an asset will go up or down in the next 5, 15, or 60 minutes.&#x20;

Such products have actively existed and traded in the traditional financial markets, we are finally bringing binary prediction markets to Polygon. The mission of Dfyn is to make DeFi more accessible for the masses and we are starting off with one of the simplest financial instruments in the world.&#x20;
