## Entering your Position for Next Round

**Step 1)** Before entering a round of the prediction market, you should check check how long is left in the current round.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the timer is too low your prediction may not confirm in time, so check there's still plenty of time left before you make a prediction (30 seconds should be enough). In case your prediction is not confirmed on time, it will automatically be rolled over to the next round.
{% endhint %}

**Step 2)** Select Bull or Bear depending on whether you believe the price of MATIC will increase or decrease.

You can checkout the payout for each position before deciding which position to take. However, the payout might change before it actually goes live.

**Step 3)** Enter the amount of MATIC you want to enter and click on Place Bet.

During times of network congestion, the transactions might go through very slowly which might cause your position to be rolled over to next round. To avoid that, participants are advised to manually increase the gas price.

Congratulations! You have successfully entered your position in the prediction markets.&#x20;
