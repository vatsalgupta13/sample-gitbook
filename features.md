### Blockchain Agnostic

Dfyn is looking to build a blockchain agnostic ecosystem that works perfectly well with all the underlying blockchain technologies. What this essentially means is that the users can use Dfyn's DEX in coalition with any blockchain network of their choice. Dfyn will also host a node-runner platform where blockchain evangelists will be able to run their own Dfyn node on the blockchain to earn passive income from fees collection.

### Transparent

Using Dfyn will be completely transparent. Users will be able to see what goes on “under the hood” every time they interact with the protocol. Furthermore, Dfyn’s smart contracts and the code base is completely open source.

### Better User Experience

By enabling zero gas transactions and smart order routing, Dfyn will ensure a much better user experience in comparison to current Layer 1 DEXs. The transaction costs will be a small fraction of the costs in the Ethereum network and the transactions will be at least 10 times faster.
