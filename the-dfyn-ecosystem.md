# The Dfyn Ecosystem

### Multi-chain AMM DEX

Dfyn is a fully decentralized multi-chain protocol which relies on automated market makers (AMMs) instead of order books to enable token swaps. Anyone can use the exchange to swap tokens, or to earn fees by supplying liquidity to various liquidity pools. On low-gas networks like Polygon, Dfyn eliminates gas fees altogether by integrating meta transactions. Currently available on Polygon and Fantom, Dfyn will eventually deploy AMM nodes on multiple layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains, thereby acting as a multi-chain DEX. An ultra-fast gasless AMM optimized for the multi blockchain universe

### Router Protocol

Dfyn will utilize Router Protocol’s cross-chain bridges to seamlessly allow communication and value-transfer between different Dfyn nodes.

## Future Scope

### Dfyn as a Cross-chain DEX

Currently a multi-chain DEX, Dfyn will evolve into a cross-chain DEX in the coming future where users will be able to trade on any blockchain network, say Ethereum from any other blockchain network, say BSC. For example, a user with 2000$ on his Ethereum wallet will be able to buy 1 Ether on BSC using Dfyn. With so many users in industry familiar with the AMM model — it becomes of essence that all new chains support a AMM based DEX and Dfyn is offering exactly that. The Dfyn AMM will be able to cater both types of trades — the user will be able to limit their trades to be filled within a single chain or the user can also explore multi-chain trades. All within the same UI.

### Layer 2 Launchpad

In the future, we intend to launch first-of-its-kind Layer 2 launchpad which will allow creators to:

* launch tokens on multiple chains
* get listed on Dfyn
* initiate farming plays and vesting with no code tools
* stake contracts on Dfyn
* undertake creatively designed Layer 2 IDO strategies in the absence of high ETH fees
