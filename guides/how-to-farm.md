# How to farm $DFYN tokens on Dfyn Exchange

Since a lot of community members have had trouble understanding the farming process, we’ve put together this step-by-step guide to help you understand the entire farming process.

### Ensuring sufficient value of both the tokens in a liquidity pair

First thing to ensure before adding liquidity to any one of Dfyn’s liquidity pools is that your wallet has enough amount of tokens for providing liquidity to the desired pool. In case it does, you can skip the following steps and jump directly to this [section](how-to-farm.md#adding-liquidity-to-dfyns-liquidity-pools-to-gain-lp-tokens). Otherwise, you need to follow these steps:

**Step 1)** Connect your MetaMask to Matic Mainnet and check your balance. Since my wallet doesn’t have sufficient amount of ETH for adding liquidity to ROUTE/ETH pool, we would need to swap some of the other assets in exchange for ETH.

**Step 2)** Go to [https://exchange.dfyn.network/](https://exchange.dfyn.network/) or [https://app.dfyn.network/](https://app.dfyn.network/).

**Step 3)** From the first dropdown, choose the asset that you want to swap from. In the second dropdown, choose the asset you want to swap into. In this case, I would be swapping my Matic tokens to ETH.

**Step 4)** Enter the amount of Matic you want to swap and click on **Swap** to initiate the transaction.

If Matic tokens on your wallet haven’t interacted with Dfyn’s smart contract before, you would be asked to Approve the interaction before swapping the assets.

**Step 5)** Before signing the transaction, Dfyn will ask you to review the transaction details and confirm the transaction. Click on **Confirm Swap** to continue.

**Step 6)** If you have turned off the gasless feature for your wallet, you will be asked to pay a very small gas fee to complete the transaction. After reviewing the gas fee, click on **Confirm**.

Your transaction should be completed within a matter of seconds. Once it does, you will receive a notification from MetaMask.

You can confirm that your tokens have been swapped by checking your wallet balance.

Now that we have enough tokens to add liquidity, we will see how we can add these tokens to Dfyn’s liquidity pools to gain LP tokens.

_**Note: You would only be allowed to add assets in 1:1 ratio (in terms of their USD value).**_

**Step 4)** Dfyn will show you the estimated number of LP tokens you will receive. Review the transaction details and click on **Confirm Supply**.

After ensuring that we have received LP tokens from Dfyn, we can move on to staking these tokens on the Dfyn farms to gain $DFYN tokens.

### Staking your LP tokens on Dfyn to farm $DFYN tokens

**Step 1)** Visit [https://exchange.dfyn.network/#/dfyn](https://exchange.dfyn.network/#/dfyn).

Identify the farm that you’re eligible for (I am eligible for ROUTE-ETH since I own ROUTE-ETH LP tokens) and click on Deposit. You can participate in multiple farms as long as you have LP tokens corresponding to that farm.

**Step 2)** In the screen that opens up following the last step, click on **Deposit Dfyn LP Tokens** at the bottom.&#x20;
